<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<h2>I am Fangda, welcome to my page</h2>
  <ul>

    <li> 1. One is always on a strange road, watching strange scenery and listening to strange music. Then one day, you will find that the things you try hard to forget are already gone.</li>
    <li> 2. We all live in the past. We take a minute to know someone, one hour to like someone, and one day to love someone, but the whole life to forget someone.</li>
    <li> 3. Don’t forget the things you once you owned. Treasure the things you can’t get. Don't give up the things that belong to you and keep those lost things in memory.</li>
    <li> 4. In your life, there will at least one time that you forget yourself for someone, asking for no result, no company, no ownership nor love. Just ask for meeting you in my most beautiful years.</li>
  </ul>
