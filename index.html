    <li> 1. One is always on a strange road, watching strange scenery and listening to strange music. Then one day, you will find that the things you try hard to forget are already gone.</li>
    <li> 2. We all live in the past. We take a minute to know someone, one hour to like someone, and one day to love someone, but the whole life to forget someone.</li>
    <li> 3. Don't forget the things you once you owned. Treasure the things you can't get. Don't give up the things that belong to you and keep those lost things in memory.</li>
    <li> 4. In your life, there will at least one time that you forget yourself for someone, asking for no result, no company, no ownership nor love. Just ask for meeting you in my most beautiful years.</li>

    <li> 5. Just keep your mind open and suck in the experience and if it hurts,it's probably worth it.</li>  
    <li> 6. Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile. </li>
    <li> 7. The fact is that the world is out of everyone's expectation. But some learn to forget, but others insist.  </li>
    <li> 8. No matter how cruel the destiny treats one with tribulation and misfortune, it will correspondingly treat him with happiness and sweetness. Even if the happiness is short and false, it's enough to light up the whole future life.  </li>
    <li> 9. Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have. </li>
    <li> 10. The more you wanna know whether you have forgotten something, the better you remember; I once heard that, the only thing you can do when you no longer have something is not to forget. </li>
    <li> 11. Love is not about running into each other in crowds. Love is an impossible meeting. For example, I am a bird flying in sky, u r a leopard in forest. We just fall in love accidentally. </li>
    <li> 12. Among those people that appear in our life, some are to teach us, some to comfortus, some to share and some to love. </li>
    <li> 13. Someone makes me comfortable, so I want to rely on him; while another one makes me feel lonely, so I want to embrace him. </li>
    <br>
    <li> Love like you've never been hurt .  </li>
    <li> Dance like nobody's watching.  </li>
    <li> Sing like nobody's listening.  </li>
    <li> work like you don't need the money . </li>
    <li> Live like it's heaven on earth.  </li>
